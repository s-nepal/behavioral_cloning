This is the solution to the 3rd project in the Udacity Self Driving Car NanoDegree program. This project involves using convolutional neural networks to train a model that predicts the steering wheel angle for a simulated car based on the images fed to it by 3 cameras located at the front of the car. The model is defined and saved in the file light_weight_network.ipynb. The file drive.py was used to feed images to the trained network and predict the corresponding steering wheel angle. The file video.py was used to create a video of the simulated car autonomously driving around the track using the predictions from the model.
